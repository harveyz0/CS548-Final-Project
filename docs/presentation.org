* Edges to Handbags
  We have little detail from the input to draw from and must fill in large blanks.
  This should enable faster design.

* Method
- U-Net architecture
We use a U-Net architecture with both a generator and a discriminator.
* Generator Down samples
- Downsample of Sequential layers
  + 2D Convolution layer
  + A Batch normalization that's optional
  + Leaky ReLU
* Generator Up sample
- Upsample of Sequential layers
  + 2D Convolution with Transpose
  + A Batch Normalization
  + An optional dropout with a rate of 0.5
  + Applying a ReLU
* Generator

[[./generator.jpg]]
* Generator
- Generator on the down we run through eight layers
- Generator with seven layers back up

* Discriminator
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.38\textwidth
[[./discriminator.jpg]]
* Discriminator
- Takes the input and target images
- Builds up three down sampler sequential layers
- Padding out the data with zeros
- Pushing that through another convolution
- Normalizing the data
- Applying Leaky ReLU
- More zero padding
- Another convolution

* Advantages and Disadvantages
** Advantages
- Seems to need short training times to get decentish results
- User input can be small
** Disadvantages
- Very limited in customizations
- Creates output data from absolutely nothing
- Is very strict in what it thinks a handbag is

* Future Works
- We've been able to show that there is the ability to generate good output from very little input
- From here you'd be best to enable further inputs to enable color and fabric selections.
- It would be best to train the algorithm to not invent outputs for data that does not exist
